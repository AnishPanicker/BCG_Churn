# PowerCo Customer Churn Prediction – Applied ML Project

Context:
This project is based on the BCG Data Science Virtual Experience (Forage),
focused on understanding and predicting customer churn for an energy utility provider (PowerCo).
The dataset used is simulated and publicly provided as part of the program.

Problem:
Customer churn leads to revenue loss and higher customer acquisition costs.

Objective:
Build a machine learning model to identify customers at high risk of churn
and prepare the system for deployment via an API.

Approach:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Baseline churn prediction model
- Evaluation using recall-focused metrics

Metric Strategy:
Recall is prioritized to minimize false negatives (missed churners).

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, SQL (analysis), FastAPI (planned), Docker (planned), MLflow (planned)

Status:
Baseline model completed. Deployment and MLOps integration in progress.
